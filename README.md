# Deep Q-Learning
Based on Deepmind's paper titled 'Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning' the model in the repo solves the Mountain-Car problem by applying Deep Q Learning.
## Contents
main.py
- consists of the training algorithm

test.py
- contains the code to test the trained model

## Usage
- Alter the hyperparameters gamma (discount factor) in main.py to generate a model that would solve the environment slected from [Open AI Gym Environments](https://github.com/openai/gym).
- To test your model run it using test.py. **Note: Change the environment in test.py if you have changed it in main.py. By default Mountian Car environment is selected.**
